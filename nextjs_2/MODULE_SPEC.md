# Guitar Module Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the implementation of the Guitar module for the Music Shop application. This will serve as the first modular product category with full CRUD functionality.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Core functionality implemented  
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Some features missing  
❌ **MISSING** - Not implemented

## Module Components

### 1. Database Schema (MongoDB) ✅

**Collection**: `guitars`  
**Status**: Implemented with full Zod validation

**Guitar Schema**:

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: string,           // Guitar name/model
  brand: string,          // Manufacturer (Fender, Gibson, etc.)
  type: string,           // "acoustic" | "electric" | "bass"
  price: number,          // Price in USD
  description: string,    // Product description
  imageUrl: string,       // Product image URL
  inStock: boolean,       // Availability status
  stockCount: number,     // Inventory count
  specifications: {
    bodyType?: string,    // Solid, hollow, semi-hollow
    neckType?: string,    // Maple, mahogany, etc.
    frets?: number,       // Number of frets
    pickups?: string,     // Pickup configuration
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 2. API Routes ⚠️

**Base Path**: `/api/guitars`  
**Status**: Core CRUD implemented, pagination missing

- ✅ `GET /api/guitars` - Get all guitars _(pagination not implemented)_
- ✅ `GET /api/guitars/[id]` - Get single guitar by ID
- ✅ `POST /api/guitars` - Create new guitar
- ✅ `PUT /api/guitars/[id]` - Update guitar
- ✅ `DELETE /api/guitars/[id]` - Delete guitar

### 3. Pages ⚠️

**Status**: Listing page implemented, detail page missing

- ✅ `/guitars` - Guitar listing page with grid layout
- ❌ `/guitars/[id]` - Guitar detail page _(not implemented)_

### 4. Zod Schemas ✅

**Status**: Fully implemented with comprehensive validation

**Files created**:

- ✅ `src/models/schemas/guitar.schema.ts` - Complete schema with validation
- ✅ `src/models/schemas/index.ts` - Updated with guitar exports
- ✅ `src/models/types/index.ts` - Type exports configured

### 5. TanStack Query Hooks ✅

**Status**: All hooks implemented with proper error handling and caching

**Queries**:

- ✅ `useGuitarsQuery()` - Fetch all guitars
- ✅ `useGuitarQuery(id)` - Fetch single guitar

**Mutations**:

- ✅ `useCreateGuitarMutation()` - Create guitar
- ✅ `useUpdateGuitarMutation()` - Update guitar
- ✅ `useDeleteGuitarMutation()` - Delete guitar

### 6. Components ⚠️

**Status**: GuitarTile implemented, detail and form components missing

- ✅ `GuitarTile` - Product card component for listings _(fully functional with image, pricing, stock status)_
- ❌ `GuitarDetail` - Detailed product view component _(not implemented)_
- ❌ `GuitarForm` - Create/edit form component (admin) _(not implemented)_

### 7. Navigation Updates ✅

**Status**: Homepage integration completed

- ✅ Update homepage guitar card to link to `/guitars`
- ✅ Add navigation structure for guitar section _(basic navigation implemented)_

## Implementation Tasks

### Backend ✅

1. ✅ **MongoDB Model**: Define Guitar schema with Zod validation
2. ✅ **API Routes**: Create dynamic API routes with full CRUD operations
3. ✅ **Data Validation**: Implement request/response validation with Zod

### Frontend ⚠️

4. ✅ **Query Hooks**: Implement TanStack Query hooks for data fetching
5. ✅ **Guitar Listing Page**: Create `/guitars` page with product grid
6. ❌ **Guitar Detail Page**: Create `/guitars/[id]` page for individual products
7. ⚠️ **Components**: Build reusable GuitarTile component _(GuitarTile done, missing GuitarDetail and GuitarForm)_
8. ✅ **Navigation**: Link homepage card to guitar section

### Integration ⚠️

9. ✅ **Homepage Integration**: Connect "Shop Guitars" button to `/guitars` page
10. ✅ **Error Handling**: Implement proper error states and loading states
11. ✅ **Type Safety**: Ensure full TypeScript coverage

## Missing Components & Next Steps

### High Priority

1. **Guitar Detail Page** (`/guitars/[id]`) - Individual product view with full specifications
2. **GuitarDetail Component** - Detailed product display component
3. **API Pagination** - Implement pagination for guitar listings
4. **Search & Filter** - Add search and filtering capabilities

### Medium Priority

5. **GuitarForm Component** - Admin form for creating/editing guitars
6. **Image Gallery** - Support for multiple product images
7. **Advanced Specifications Display** - Better technical specs presentation

### Low Priority

8. **SEO Optimization** - Meta tags and structured data for product pages
9. **Caching Strategy** - Implement advanced caching for performance
10. **Admin Interface** - Complete admin functionality for guitar management

## Implementation Decisions & Clarifications

Based on the current implementation, the following decisions have been made:

### Data & Business Logic ✅ DECIDED

1. **Image Storage**: ✅ External URLs (Unsplash) - Schema validates URL format
2. **Pricing**: ✅ USD only - Single number field for price
3. **Inventory**: ✅ Exact stock counts - Both `inStock` boolean and `stockCount` number tracked
4. **Categories**: ✅ Simple type system - Three types: "acoustic", "electric", "bass"

### Features & Functionality ⚠️ PARTIALLY DECIDED

5. **Search & Filter**: ❌ Not implemented - No search/filter on guitars page
6. **Sorting**: ❌ Not implemented - No sorting options available
7. **Pagination**: ❌ Not implemented - API returns all guitars
8. **Admin Features**: ⚠️ Basic mutation hooks only - No admin UI, just API endpoints

### UI/UX ⚠️ PARTIALLY DECIDED

9. **Product Images**: ✅ Single main image - One `imageUrl` per guitar
10. **Guitar Specifications**: ✅ Basic specs - bodyType, neckType, frets, pickups displayed
11. **Purchase Flow**: ❌ Display only - No cart functionality, just "View Details" buttons
12. **Responsive Design**: ✅ Responsive grid - Tailwind responsive classes implemented

### Technical ✅ DECIDED

13. **Sample Data**: ✅ Example data generator - "Add Example" button creates sample guitars
14. **Caching Strategy**: ✅ TanStack Query - Automatic caching and invalidation
15. **SEO**: ❌ Not implemented - No meta tags or structured data

## Remaining Questions for Product Direction

### Business Requirements

1. **Search Priority**: How important is search/filter functionality for initial launch?
2. **Admin Interface**: Do we need a full admin UI or are API endpoints sufficient?
3. **Purchase Integration**: Will this integrate with an e-commerce system later?
4. **Content Management**: How will guitar data be managed in production?

### Performance & Scale

5. **Expected Volume**: How many guitars are expected in the catalog?
6. **Pagination Strategy**: What's the preferred page size for guitar listings?
7. **Image Strategy**: Should we optimize for different screen sizes/resolutions?

### User Experience

8. **Detail Page Priority**: How detailed should individual guitar pages be?
9. **Comparison Features**: Do users need to compare multiple guitars?
10. **Mobile Experience**: Any specific mobile-first requirements?

## Summary

### What's Working ✅

- **Complete CRUD API** with full validation
- **Responsive guitar listings** with grid layout
- **Type-safe data layer** with Zod schemas
- **Real-time UI updates** with TanStack Query
- **Error handling** and loading states
- **Sample data generation** for testing
- **Homepage integration** with navigation

### Critical Gaps ❌

- **No guitar detail pages** - Users can't view individual products
- **No pagination** - Will not scale with large catalogs
- **No search/filter** - Poor user experience with many products
- **No admin interface** - Content management relies on API only

### Architecture Quality ⭐

- **Excellent**: Type safety, validation, error handling
- **Good**: Component structure, query management, responsive design
- **Needs Work**: Feature completeness, scalability concerns

The guitar module provides a solid foundation with excellent technical architecture, but needs key user-facing features to be production-ready.
